### 1_AEC-HE_HSPC_trajectories.ipynb
Code used to generate: FDG overlaid with PAGA showing trajectory of HE transition to HSPC in YS scRNA-seq dataset (n=3, k=2262) (left) and feature plots of key genes (IL33, ALDH1A1, GFI1) involved in endothelial to hemogenic transition (right) (Supplementary Table 27). i. Stills of 3D (left) and 2D z-stack (right) light-sheet fluorescence microscopy images of a 7PCW YS stained with LYVE1 and PLVAP (top). Scale bar=700um; see

### 2_YS_CPDB_interactions_across_time.ipynb
Code used to generate: Heatmap showing curated and statistically significant (P<0.05) CellphoneDB-predicted interactions between YS HSPCs and stromal cells that change across gestational age. Color scale indicates relative mean expression z-scores. (F) Schematic of selected and statistically significant (P<0.05) CellphoneDB-predicted interactions between YS HSPCs and endoderm, fibroblasts (Fib), smooth muscle cells (SMC), or endothelial cells (EC) derived from scRNA- seq data. Interactions are grouped by predicted receptor to ECM interactions, ligandâ€“receptor interactions, and surface-bound ligand-receptor interactions. Receptors and ligands in italics significantly decrease at CS17-23 (6-8PCW). See Materials and Methods and tables S28 and 29.

### 3_A1_V5_cellrank_HSPC_transition_probability.ipynb
Code used to determine probability of transition for each curated terminal state in the YS, used to guide robust trajectory inference between AEC to HSPCs.
