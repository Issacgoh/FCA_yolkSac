Code used to generate: Mean logistic regression class prediction probabilities for a model trained on YS scRNA-seq myeloid cell states projected onto cells with classification probability threshold of 0.7 to predict macrophages and microglia/TREM2 macrophages in external fetal brain dataset.

### Extended_figure_6f_2_AR.ipynb
Code used to generate: Mean logistic regression class prediction probabilities for a model trained on YS scRNA-seq myeloid cell states projected onto cells with classification probability threshold of 0.7 to predict macrophages and microglia/TREM2 macrophages in external fetal skin dataset.
