# Extended_data_Figure_7 scripts
This directory contains code for the approaches used to generate figures and analyses used in Figure7 of our manuscript. 

### 1_Extended_figure_7a_AR.ipynb
Code used to generate: Dot plot showing the level (colour scale) and percent expression (dot size) of select DEGs (Supplementary Table 12) between YS endoderm (main and gastrula (gast.) data) and embryonic liver (EL) hepatocytes. Data log-normalised and scaled max_value=10.

### 2_Extended_figure_7c_AR.ipynb
Code used to generate:Dot plot showing the level (colour scale) and percent expression (dot size) of soluble factors expressed by YS (main and gastrula (gast) data) and EL cell states. Datasets log-normalised and scaled max_value=10, adult liver and kidney scaled independently and combined after.
